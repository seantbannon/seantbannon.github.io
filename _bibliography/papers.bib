abstract = {Oxidative stress plays a critical role in cellular dysfunction associated with cigarette smoke exposure and aging. Some chemicals from tobacco smoke have the potential to amplify mitochondrial ROS (mROS) production, which, in turn, may impair mitochondrial respiratory function. Accordingly, the present study tested the hypothesis that a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (MitoTEMPO, MT) would attenuate the inhibitory effects of cigarette smoke on skeletal muscle respiratory capacity of middle-aged mice. Specifically, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was assessed using high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized fibers from the fast-twitch gastrocnemius muscle of middle-aged C57Bl/6J mice. Before the assessment of respiration, tissues were incubated for 1hr with a control buffer (CON), cigarette smoke condensate (2 % dilution, SMOKE), or MitoTEMPO (10 μM) combined with cigarette smoke condensate (MT + SMOKE). Cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) decreased maximal-ADP stimulated respiration (CON: 60 ± 15 pmolO2.s−1.mg−1 and SMOKE: 33 ± 8 pmolO2.s−1.mg−1; p = 0.0001), and this effect was attenuated by MT (MT + SMOKE: 41 ± 7 pmolO2.s−1.mg−1; p = 0.02 with SMOKE). Complex-I specific respiration was inhibited by CSC, with no significant effect of MT (p = 0.35). Unlike CON, the addition of glutamate (ΔGlutamate) had an additive effect on respiration in fibers exposed to CSC (CON: 0.9 ± 1.1 pmolO2.s−1.mg−1 and SMOKE: 5.4 ± 3.7 pmolO2.s−1.mg−1; p = 0.008) and MT (MT + SMOKE: 8.2 ± 3.8 pmolO2.s−1.mg−1; p ≤ 0.01). Complex-II specific respiration was inhibited by CSC but was partially restored by MT (p = 0.04 with SMOKE). Maximal uncoupled respiration induced by FCCP was inhibited by CSC, with no significant effect of MT. These findings underscore that mROS contributes to cigarette smoke condensate-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in fast-twitch gastrocnemius muscle fibers of middle-aged mice thus providing a potential target for therapeutic treatment of smoke-related diseases. In addition, this study revealed that CSC largely impaired muscle respiratory capacity by decreasing metabolic flux through mitochondrial pyruvate transporter (MPC) and/or the enzymes upstream of α-ketoglutarate in the Krebs cycle.}

abstract = {Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that cigarette smoke exposure alters glucose and fatty acid metabolism, leading to greater susceptibility to metabolic disorders. However, the effects of cigarette smoke exposure on mitochondrial substrate oxidation in the skeletal muscle are still poorly understood. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the acute effects of cigarette smoke on mitochondrial respiratory capacity, sensitivity, and concurrent utilization of palmitoylcarnitine (PC), a long-chain fatty acid, and pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, in permeabilized gastrocnemius and soleus muscle fibers exposed to an acute (1 h) dose (4 %) of cigarette smoke concentrate. Cigarette smoke decreased both mitochondrial respiratory capacity (CONTROL: 50.4 ± 11.8 pmolO2/s/mgwt and SMOKE: 22.3 ± 4.4 pmolO2/s/mgwt, p < 0.01) and sensitivity for pyruvate (CONTROL: 0.10 ± 0.04 mM and SMOKE: 0.11 ± 0.04 mM, p < 0.01) in the gastrocnemius muscle. In the soleus, only the sensitivity for pyruvate-stimulated mitochondrial respiration trended toward a decrease (CONTROL: 0.11 ± 0.04 mM and SMOKE: 0.23 ± 0.15 mM, p = 0.08). In contrast, cigarette smoke did not significantly alter palmitoylcarnitine-stimulated mitochondrial respiration in either muscle. In the control condition, pyruvate-supported respiration was inhibited by the concurrent addition of palmitoylcarnitine in the fast-twitch gastrocnemius muscle (−27.1 ± 19.7 %, p < 0.05), but not in the slow-twitch soleus (−9.2 ± 17.0 %). With cigarette smoke, the addition of palmitoylcarnitine augmented the maximal respiration rate stimulated by the concurrent addition of pyruvate in the gastrocnemius (+18.5 ± 39.3 %, p < 0.05). However, cigarette smoke still significantly impaired mitochondrial respiratory capacity with combined substrates compared to control (p < 0.05). Our findings underscore that cigarette smoke directly impairs mitochondrial respiration of carbohydrate-derived substrates and is a primary mechanism underlying cigarette smoke-induced muscle dysfunction, which leads to a vicious cycle involving excess glucose conversion into fatty acids and lipotoxicity.}

    abstract = { Cigarette smoke exposure is a well-known risk factor for developing numerous chronic health conditions, including pulmonary disease and cardiometabolic disorders. However, the cellular mechanisms mediating the toxicity of cigarette smoke in extrapulmonary tissues are still poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the acute dose-dependent toxicity of cigarette smoke on mitochondrial metabolism by determining the susceptibility and sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration from murine skeletal (gastrocnemius and soleus) and cardiac muscles, as well as the aorta to cigarette smoke concentrate (CSC). In all tissues, exposure to CSC inhibited tissue-specific respiration capacity, measured by high-resolution respirometry, according to a biphasic pattern. With a break point of 451 ± 235 μg/mL, the aorta was the least susceptible to CSC-induced mitochondrial respiration inhibition compared with the gastrocnemius (151 ± 109 μg/mL; P = 0.008, d = 2.3), soleus (211 ± 107 μg/mL; P = 0.112; d = 1.7), and heart (94 ± 51 μg/mL; P < 0.001; d = 2.6) suggesting an intrinsic resistance of the vascular smooth muscle mitochondria to cigarette smoke toxicity. In contrast, the cardiac muscle was the most susceptible and sensitive to the effects of CSC, demonstrating the greatest decline in tissue-specific respiration with increasing CSC concentration (P < 0.001, except the soleus). However, when normalized to citrate synthase activity to account for differences in mitochondrial content, cardiac fibers’ sensitivity to cigarette smoke inhibition was no longer significantly different from both fast-twitch gastrocnemius and slow-twitch soleus muscle fibers, thus suggesting similar mitochondrial phenotypes. Collectively, these findings established the acute dose-dependent toxicity of cigarette smoke on oxidative phosphorylation in permeabilized tissues involved in the development of smoke-related cardiometabolic diseases.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Despite numerous investigations into the mechanisms underlying cigarette smoke-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, no studies have investigated the tissue-specific mitochondrial toxicity to cigarette smoke. We demonstrate that, while aorta is least sensitive and susceptible to cigarette smoke-induced toxicity, the degree of cigarette smoke-induced toxicity in striated muscle depends on the tissue-specific mitochondrial content. We conclude that while the mitochondrial content influences cigarette smoke-induced toxicity in striated muscles, aorta is intrinsically protected against cigarette smoke-induced mitochondrial toxicity. }

abstract = {Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), a degenerative corneal condition, is characterized by the droplet-like accumulation of the extracellular matrix, known as guttae and progressive loss of corneal endothelial cells ultimately leading to visual distortion and glare. FECD can be influenced by environmental stressors and genetic conditions. However, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction for advancing FECD pathogenesis is not yet fully studied. Therefore, in the present study we sought to determine whether a combination of environmental stressors (ultraviolet-A (UVA) light and cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)) can induce mitochondrial dysfunction leading to FECD. We also investigated if MitoQ, a water-soluble antioxidant, can target mitochondrial dysfunction induced by UVA and CSC in human corneal endothelial cells mitigating FECD pathogenesis. We modeled the FECD by increasing exogenous oxidative stress with CSC (0.2%), UVA (25J/cm2) and a combination of UVA + CSC and performed a temporal analysis of their cellular and mitochondrial effects on HCEnC-21T immortalized cells in vitro before and after MitoQ (0.05 μM) treatment. Interestingly, we observed that a combination of UVA + CSC exposure increased mitochondrial ROS and fragmentation leading to a lower mitochondrial membrane potential and increased levels of cytochrome c release leading to apoptosis and cell death. MitoQ intervention successfully mitigated these effects and restored cell viability. The UVA + CSC model could be used to study stress induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, MitoQ can serve as a viable antioxidant in attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction, underscoring its potential as a molecular-focused treatment approach to combat FECD pathogenesis.}

    abstract = { Introduction: Mitochondrial effciency provides an additional mechanism to fine-tune oxidative phosphorylation rate to match ATP demand in skeletal muscle with far-reaching consequences on exercise tolerance. However, the direct measurement of both oxygen consumption (VO2) and ATP production from the same region of the contracting muscle in vivo remains a technical challenge. Purpose: Using an innovative approach combining noninvasive phosphorus and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P/1H-MRS), the present study aimed to characterize skeletal muscle ATP synthesis rate and muscle VO2 at rest and during a graded dynamic plantar flexion exercise to determine mitochondrial effciency in the gastrocnemius muscle. Method: We assessed mitochondrial effciency in the gastrocnemius muscles of 12 healthy adults (21± 1 yrs.). 31P and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed using a whole-body 3T MR system (Skyra, Siemens) at rest and during a series of constant workloads coupled to brief transient ischemia to quantify both oxidative ATP synthesis (ATPox) rate and myoglobin-derived oxygen consumption (Mb-derived VO2). The MRS data were acquired with a dual-tuned 31P/1H surface coil with linear polarization positioned over the gastrocnemius muscle. Results: As expected, the end-exercise PCr concentration decreased from 29 ± 2 mM of WRmax to 18 ± 1 mM with increasing workload. Likewise, the end-exercise Mb oxygenation level declined linearly with increasing workload. As the exercise workload increased, the ATPox synthesis rate increased linearly (r2 = 0.45), whereas there was no significant change in Mb-derived VO2. At rest, the estimated P/O ratio in the gastrocnemius muscle was 1.95 ± 0.68, whereas non-physiological values were obtained during exercise. Conclusion: During exercise, Mb-derived VO2 was likely limited by O2 availability with the methodology employed (30-sec occlusion, spectrum time resolution of 10 sec), which precluded the accurate quantification of mitochondrial effciency. However, mitochondrial effciency calculated at rest is in agreement with previously documented values ex vivo and thus provides an additional parameter to evaluate mitochondrial function in vivo.

	abstract = {Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a genetic oxidative stress disorder, which is more prevalent in females and smokers. Previously, we have shown that ultraviolet-A (UVA) light, by inducing DNA damage, causes corneal endothelial cell (CEnC) loss, indicative of FECD phenotype in mice. However, there is little evidence whether cigarette smoke, in addition to UVA, enhances the development of FECD. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of UVA and smoking on cell cycle arrest, endothelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and senescence seen in FECD.    Telomerase-immortalized CEnCs (HCEnC-T21M) were treated with either a single dose of UVA (25J/cm2), cigarette smoke condensate (CSC, 80 μg/mL), or concurrent UVA and CSC exposure (CSC+UVA) for 24 hours. The cells were analyzed for DNA damage (yH2AX and p53), senescence (p21, CDKN1A), and EMT (SNAI1, TGFBIp) markers by immunofluorescence, western blotting, and real-time PCR. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test was employed to detect statistical differences (p\&lt;0.05).    CEnCs treated with CSC (7.4±1.1\%), UVA (10.0±1.6\%), and UVA+CSC (13.6±2.3\%) showed significantly higher percentage of yH2AX foci compared to controls (0.6±0.9\%) (p\&lt;0.05). p53 expression was observed in UVA and UVA+CSC, but not in CSC alone. Greater p21 positivity was seen in CSC (4.5±1.3\%), UVA (6.0±1.8\%), and CSC+UVA (9.5±3.1\%) compared to untreated controls (0.25±0.5\%). Real -time PCR revealed increased SNAI1, TGFBIp and CDKN1A expression in the CSC+UVA group compared to control. Greater G2/M cell cycle reentry and arrest was induced in CSC+UV group (45.8±6.5\%) compared to untreated (19.3±2.2\%), CSC (21.1±3.0\%) and UVA only (27.6±6.3\%) standalone treatments (p\&lt;0.001).    Combination of UVA with CSC exacerbates DNA damage and leads to increased G2/M cell cycle arrest that activates cellular senescence and causes FECD phenotype. Both UVA and smoking are environmental stressors that induce oxidative stress, pointing to the role of modifiable risk factors in FECD pathogenesis.

While these methods generally scale to large samples, image analysis remains challenging, often requiring manual parameter tuning. We present Piscis, a fully automatic deep learning algorithm for spot detection trained using a novel loss function, the SmoothF1 loss, that approximates the F1 score to directly penalize false positives and false negatives but remains differentiable and hence usable for training by deep learning approaches. Piscis was trained and tested on a diverse dataset composed of 358 manually annotated experimental RNA FISH images representing multiple cell types and 240 additional synthetic images.
