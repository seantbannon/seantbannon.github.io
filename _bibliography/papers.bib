  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH)-based spatial transcriptomics methods have enabled the accurate quantification of gene expression at single-cell resolution by visualizing transcripts as diffraction-limited spots. While these methods generally scale to large samples, image analysis remains challenging, often requiring manual parameter tuning. We present Piscis, a fully automatic deep learning algorithm for spot detection trained using a novel loss function, the SmoothF1 loss, that approximates the F1 score to directly penalize false positives and false negatives but remains differentiable and hence usable for training by deep learning approaches. Piscis was trained and tested on a diverse dataset composed of 358 manually annotated experimental RNA FISH images representing multiple cell types and 240 additional synthetic images. Piscis outperforms other state-of-the-art spot detection methods, enabling accurate, high-throughput analysis of RNA FISH-derived imaging data without the need for manual parameter tuning.Competing Interest StatementA.R. receives royalties related to Stellaris RNA FISH probes.
